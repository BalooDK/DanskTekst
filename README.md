DanskTekst
==========

DanskTekst is a watchface for Pebble (http://getpebble.com) that uses danish natural language to show the time of day, highlighting the hour, and animating minute changes.

PebbleTextWatch (https://github.com/wearewip/PebbleTextWatch) was used as a skeleton for the code which was expanded with 4 lines, arrays and a custom font to have room for all the text.

Parts of the font code inspired by http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/4265/swedish-fuzzy-time
